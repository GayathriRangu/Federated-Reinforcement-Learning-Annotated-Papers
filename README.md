# Federated-Reinforcement-Learning-Annotated-Papers
Notes and annotated papers related to Federated Reinforcement learning in robotics and RL in general. 
It so happens that we often read a lot of research papers but we lose track of them as the years pass by. It requires a lot of time and energy to re-read them in the same order. My vision is to come here, 10 years down the line, and look at this well-organized rep and feel proud of myself! Hope you find something useful out here!:)

Happy Reading!
